Program FAQs







1. What are Prime Exclusive Phones?

Third party smartphones made available to Prime members as part of our Prime Exclusive Phones program. Prime Exclusive Phones are typically offered at discounted prices or are available exclusively as part of the Prime Exclusive Phones program.  The Prime Exclusive Phone single sign-on experience provides Prime members easy access to Prime benefits through a pre-installed selection of popular Amazon apps, including the Amazon Widget app. Learn more about Prime benefits.

2. Do Prime Exclusive Phones have lockscreen offers and ads?

Starting in February 2018, Prime Exclusive Phones are available without lockscreen offers and ads. This change allows you to personalize your Prime Exclusive Phone’s lockscreen and to more easily use your phone’s unlock technologies, such as facial recognition and fingerprint sensors.

3. Will I still be able to access deals and offers on my Prime Exclusive Phone?

The Amazon Widget app will still be available on your Prime Exclusive Phone, giving you quick access to daily deals and time-limited promotional offers. You can also use the Amazon Widget app to access your Amazon account information, including Orders and Lists.

4. Why am I still seeing lockscreen offers and ads on my Prime Exclusive Phone?

A February 2018 update to the Amazon Offers app disables lockscreen offers and ads on Prime Exclusive Phones. If you continue to see lockscreen offers and ads, please make sure you have connected your Prime Exclusive Phone to Wi-Fi and updated the Amazon Offers app. Learn more about updating your Prime Exclusive Phone. If you have completed these actions and continue to see lockscreen offers and ads after February 2018, please contact customer service for assistance.

5. What information are you collecting about devices in the program, and how do you use it?

We collect information about your use of your device, including your device’s system and stability, applications and services on the device, and your device’s interaction with software, applications, and services on the device. We may be provided this information directly from the device or its manufacturer. We use this information in order to provide, improve, and maintain the operability of our products and services, including the Amazon Widget app.

The Prime Exclusive Phone single sign-on experience provides Prime members easy access to Prime benefits through a pre-installed selection of popular Amazon apps, including the Amazon Widget app. Learn more about Prime benefits.

2. Do Prime Exclusive Phones have lockscreen offers and ads?

Starting in February 2018, Prime Exclusive Phones are available without lockscreen offers and ads. This change allows you to personalize your Prime Exclusive Phone’s lockscreen and to more easily use your phone’s unlock technologies, such as facial recognition and fingerprint sensors.

3. Will I still be able to access deals and offers on my Prime Exclusive Phone?

The Amazon Widget app will still be available on your Prime Exclusive Phone, giving you quick access to daily deals and time-limited promotional offers. You can also use the Amazon Widget app to access your Amazon account information, including Orders and Lists.

Program FAQs







1. What are Prime Exclusive Phones?

Third party smartphones made available to Prime members as part of our Prime Exclusive Phones program. Prime Exclusive Phones are typically offered at discounted prices or are available exclusively as part of the Prime Exclusive Phones program.  The Prime Exclusive Phone single sign-on experience provides Prime members easy access to Prime benefits through a pre-installed selection of popular Amazon apps, including the Amazon Widget app. Learn more about Prime benefits.

2. Do Prime Exclusive Phones have lockscreen offers and ads?

Starting in February 2018, Prime Exclusive Phones are available without lockscreen offers and ads. This change allows you to personalize your Prime Exclusive Phone’s lockscreen and to more easily use your phone’s unlock technologies, such as facial recognition and fingerprint sensors.

3. Will I still be able to access deals and offers on my Prime Exclusive Phone?

The Amazon Widget app will still be available on your Prime Exclusive Phone, giving you quick access to daily deals and time-limited promotional offers. You can also use the Amazon Widget app to access your Amazon account information, including Orders and Lists.

4. Why am I still seeing lockscreen offers and ads on my Prime Exclusive Phone?

A February 2018 update to the Amazon Offers app disables lockscreen offers and ads on Prime Exclusive Phones. If you continue to see lockscreen offers and ads, please make sure you have connected your Prime Exclusive Phone to Wi-Fi and updated the Amazon Offers app. Learn more about updating your Prime Exclusive Phone. If you have completed these actions and continue to see lockscreen offers and ads after February 2018, please contact customer service for assistance.

5. What information are you collecting about devices in the program, and how do you use it?

We collect information about your use of your device, including your device’s system and stability, applications and services on the device, and your device’s interaction with software, applications, and services on the device. We may be provided this information directly from the device or its manufacturer. We use this information in order to provide, improve, and maintain the operability of our products and services, including the Amazon Widget app.

1. What are Prime Exclusive Phones?

Third party smartphones made available to Prime members as part of our Prime Exclusive Phones program. Prime Exclusive Phones are typically offered at discounted prices or are available exclusively as part of the Prime Exclusive Phones program.  The Prime Exclusive Phone single sign-on experience provides Prime members easy access to Prime benefits through a pre-installed selection of popular Amazon apps, including the Amazon Widget app. Learn more about Prime benefits.

2. Do Prime Exclusive Phones have lockscreen offers and ads?

Starting in February 2018, Prime Exclusive Phones are available without lockscreen offers and ads. This change allows you to personalize your Prime Exclusive Phone’s lockscreen and to more easily use your phone’s unlock technologies, such as facial recognition and fingerprint sensors.

3. Will I still be able to access deals and offers on my Prime Exclusive Phone?

The Amazon Widget app will still be available on your Prime Exclusive Phone, giving you quick access to daily deals and time-limited promotional offers. You can also use the Amazon Widget app to access your Amazon account information, including Orders and Lists.

4. Why am I still seeing lockscreen offers and ads on my Prime Exclusive Phone?

A February 2018 update to the Amazon Offers app disables lockscreen offers and ads on Prime Exclusive Phones. If you continue to see lockscreen offers and ads, please make sure you have connected your Prime Exclusive Phone to Wi-Fi and updated the Amazon Offers app. Learn more about updating your Prime Exclusive Phone. If you have completed these actions and continue to see lockscreen offers and ads after February 2018, please contact customer service for assistance.

Program FAQs







1. What are Prime Exclusive Phones?

Third party smartphones made available to Prime members as part of our Prime Exclusive Phones program. Prime Exclusive Phones are typically offered at discounted prices or are available exclusively as part of the Prime Exclusive Phones program.  The Prime Exclusive Phone single sign-on experience provides Prime members easy access to Prime benefits through a pre-installed selection of popular Amazon apps, including the Amazon Widget app. Learn more about Prime benefits.

2. Do Prime Exclusive Phones have lockscreen offers and ads?

Starting in February 2018, Prime Exclusive Phones are available without lockscreen offers and ads. This change allows you to personalize your Prime Exclusive Phone’s lockscreen and to more easily use your phone’s unlock technologies, such as facial recognition and fingerprint sensors.

3. Will I still be able to access deals and offers on my Prime Exclusive Phone?

The Amazon Widget app will still be available on your Prime Exclusive Phone, giving you quick access to daily deals and time-limited promotional offers. You can also use the Amazon Widget app to access your Amazon account information, including Orders and Lists.

4. Why am I still seeing lockscreen offers and ads on my Prime Exclusive Phone?

A February 2018 update to the Amazon Offers app disables lockscreen offers and ads on Prime Exclusive Phones. If you continue to see lockscreen offers and ads, please make sure you have connected your Prime Exclusive Phone to Wi-Fi and updated the Amazon Offers app. Learn more about updating your Prime Exclusive Phone. If you have completed these actions and continue to see lockscreen offers and ads after February 2018, please contact customer service for assistance.

Program FAQs







1. What are Prime Exclusive Phones?

Third party smartphones made available to Prime members as part of our Prime Exclusive Phones program. Prime Exclusive Phones are typically offered at discounted prices or are available exclusively as part of the Prime Exclusive Phones program.  The Prime Exclusive Phone single sign-on experience provides Prime members easy access to Prime benefits through a pre-installed selection of popular Amazon apps, including the Amazon Widget app. Learn more about Prime benefits.

2. Do Prime Exclusive Phones have lockscreen offers and ads?

Starting in February 2018, Prime Exclusive Phones are available without lockscreen offers and ads. This change allows you to personalize your Prime Exclusive Phone’s lockscreen and to more easily use your phone’s unlock technologies, such as facial recognition and fingerprint sensors.

3. Will I still be able to access deals and offers on my Prime Exclusive Phone?

The Amazon Widget app will still be available on your Prime Exclusive Phone, giving you quick access to daily deals and time-limited promotional offers. You can also use the Amazon Widget app to access your Amazon account information, including Orders and Lists.

4. Why am I still seeing lockscreen offers and ads on my Prime Exclusive Phone?

A February 2018 update to the Amazon Offers app disables lockscreen offers and ads on Prime Exclusive Phones. If you continue to see lockscreen offers and ads, please make sure you have connected your Prime Exclusive Phone to Wi-Fi and updated the Amazon Offers app. Learn more about updating your Prime Exclusive Phone. If you have completed these actions and continue to see lockscreen offers and ads after February 2018, please contact customer service for assistance.

5. What information are you collecting about devices in the program, and how do you use it?

We collect information about your use of your device, including your device’s system and stability, applications and services on the device, and your device’s interaction with software, applications, and services on the device. We may be provided this information directly from the device or its manufacturer. We use this information in order to provide, improve, and maintain the operability of our products and services, including the Amazon Widget app.

Program FAQs







1. What are Prime Exclusive Phones?

Third party smartphones made available to Prime members as part of our Prime Exclusive Phones program. Prime Exclusive Phones are typically offered at discounted prices or are available exclusively as part of the Prime Exclusive Phones program.  The Prime Exclusive Phone single sign-on experience provides Prime members easy access to Prime benefits through a pre-installed selection of popular Amazon apps, including the Amazon Widget app. Learn more about Prime benefits.

2. Do Prime Exclusive Phones have lockscreen offers and ads?

Starting in February 2018, Prime Exclusive Phones are available without lockscreen offers and ads. This change allows you to personalize your Prime Exclusive Phone’s lockscreen and to more easily use your phone’s unlock technologies, such as facial recognition and fingerprint sensors.

3. Will I still be able to access deals and offers on my Prime Exclusive Phone?

The Amazon Widget app will still be available on your Prime Exclusive Phone, giving you quick access to daily deals and time-limited promotional offers. You can also use the Amazon Widget app to access your Amazon account information, including Orders and Lists.

4. Why am I still seeing lockscreen offers and ads on my Prime Exclusive Phone?

A February 2018 update to the Amazon Offers app disables lockscreen offers and ads on Prime Exclusive Phones. If you continue to see lockscreen offers and ads, please make sure you have connected your Prime Exclusive Phone to Wi-Fi and updated the Amazon Offers app. Learn more about updating your Prime Exclusive Phone. If you have completed these actions and continue to see lockscreen offers and ads after February 2018, please contact customer service for assistance.

5. What information are you collecting about devices in the program, and how do you use it?

We collect information about your use of your device, including your device’s system and stability, applications and services on the device, and your device’s interaction with software, applications, and services on the device. We may be provided this information directly from the device or its manufacturer. We use this information in order to provide, improve, and maintain the operability of our products and services, including the Amazon Widget app.
