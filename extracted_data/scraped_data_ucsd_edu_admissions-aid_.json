Let\u2019s get going.\nChoosing to study at UC is a major decision. But we\u2019re confident you\u2019re making the right one.\nEach campus offers an incredible range of experiences and academic programs. Whether you want to be in a big city, nestled in a redwood forest or on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, there's something for everyone.\nCome be a part of it.\nWhat you'll need\nIt's a good idea to have everything prepared before you start your application so you're not trying to track down information at the last minute.\nHere's what you'll need:\n\nTranscripts. Don't submit your transcripts to UC at this point, but refer to them as you fill out the application to ensure the information you enter is accurate.*\nAnnual income for last year and the current year (your parents' if you're a dependent; your income if you're independent). This is optional unless you're applying for an application fee waiver or for the Educational Opportunity Program.\nSocial Security number, if you have one. We use this to match your application to things like your test score report, final transcript(s) and, if you're applying for financial aid, your Free Application for Federal Student Aid.\nCitizenship status. You must enter your country of citizenship (or \"No Selection\"). If your country of citizenship is outside the United States, you'll need to provide your immigration status and your visa type.\nCalifornia Statewide Student ID (optional). Each K-12 student in California public schools is assigned an ID number. If it's not printed on your transcript, ask your counselor or registrar.\nCredit card. If you prefer to pay by check, you can mail your payment.\n\n\n* Veterans or active-duty military personnel:\u00a0If you completed courses offered by a branch of the U.S. military, you may indicate your intention to submit your military transcript by checking the box in the \"About You\" section of the application. If you are admitted and accept an offer of admission, you can then submit official military transcripts (e.g., JST) to the UC campus.\nApplication fees & waivers\nThe application fee is $80 for each UC campus ($95 for international and non-immigrant applicants). You can make your payment either by credit card or by mail, just be sure follow the instructions in the application.\nOnce your application has been submitted, you are expected to pay for all your campus choices, even if you cancel your application at a later date.
